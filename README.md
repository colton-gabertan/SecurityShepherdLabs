# Cross Site Scripting 1

**Instructions:**

Generic XSS injections:
```HTML
<SCRIPT>alert('XSS')</SCRIPT>
<IMG SRC="#" ONERROR="alert('XSS')"/>
<INPUT TYPE="BUTTON" ONCLICK="alert('XSS')"/>
<IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');"></IFRAME>
```

Find a XSS vulnerability in the following form. It would appear that your input is being filtered!

## Lab Walkthrough

As I mentioned in the intro, the first line of defense agains XSS attacks is filtering input. Developers will take the strings and strip it of characters or substrings that would allow XSS; however, the filter is only as good as the developer.

As a starting-point, let's try re-running the tag from the first task.

### Probing XSS filter

So, it looks like it took the inner part of the SCRIPT tags, and simply recognized the javascript alert as a string. Let's take a closer look at the page by inspecting the error message.

### Source Code of Error Message

Interesting, in this div, the SCRIPT tag looks like <scr.pt>. This, combined with the fact that the inside of our original SCRIPT tags was treated as a regular string can mean that this app filters out the SCRIPT tag. Luckily, there's ways to inject javascript within other tags. Take a look at the generic injections and test one out.

Since inputting an IMG tag would likely cause the page to throw an error, I'm opting to try out the second line:
``` HTML
<IMG SRC="#" ONERROR="alert('XSS')"/>
```

Just a quick breakdown of this line: \
The expected input is a regular string, so trying to insert some HTML will more than likely cause the error to be thrown. Since the IMG needs the src attribute, all we need to do is comment out the value with "#". The nice thing about this tag is that we are allowed to use the ONERROR attribute and inject our javascript here.

So now, let's test our assumption that the SCRIPT tag is the only thing getting filtered out.

### Bypassing Filter

Thanks to a bit of testing in the beginning, we were able to come to a solid argument and test our hypothesis. This was a very trivial filter. In the next tasks, we will need to start getting even more creative.
