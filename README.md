# Session Management Challenge 2

**Instructions:**

Only an admin of the following sub-application can retrieve the result key to this challenge.

## Lab Walkthrough

This time around we are trying to get past some login credentials via poor session management. There's the login form and a reset password option, pretty standard for most web applications. Hence the prompt, let's try to see what happens when we login with the username *admin* and password *password*.

### Server Response

In general when looking for vulnerabilities in web apps, it's always a good idea to get a feel for how it behaves, see if the default behavior itself presents any entry-points for us. As you can see, it looks like the username, "admin" was registered to that email address from the failed login attempt. Now that we have an email for the password reset, let's check out how this app chooses to reset passwords.

At this point I've chosen to crack open Burpsuite in order to observe the server response to this request.

### Password Reset Response

Interestingly enough, this server sends the new password as a response in the clear! All that's left is to login as admin with the new, reset password and grab that key.

### Secure Web Application Design Considerations

As demonstrated in this lab, that was a very poorly designed login feature and login recovery feature, in terms of security. Always consider your user's sensitive data, and never display any of it in the front-end or in the clear. Always be weary of how easy it is to capture back and forth traffic, and use a bit of common sense to protect not only your application, but also your users.
