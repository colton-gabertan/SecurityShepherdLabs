# Fixed XOR

**Description:**

This python script performs a fixed XOR operation on hex values. This is used as weak symmetric encryption algorithm.

## CTF Walkthrough

Before we get into coding the script, you must first understand how the xor operation works on a set of binary digits. "XOR" (^) stands for "exclusive or", meaning in order for this operation to evaluate to true, both of the operands must be different. So, only a 1 ^ 0 or a 0 ^ 1 will evaluate to 1. 1 ^ 1 and 0 ^ 0 both evaluate to 0.

Given 01101001 and 00111010 we can xor these two values like so: \
*starting from the right-most bit going to the left*

### Fixed XOR as Encryption & Decryption
```
01101001 - value 1      01010011 - encrypted              01010011 - encrypted
00111010 - value 2      00111010 - value 2                01101001 - value 1
--------                --------                          --------
01010011 - encrypted    01101001 - value 1 (decrypted)    00111010 - value 2 (decrypted) 
```
