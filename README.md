## Lab Walkthrough

This challenge is essentially the exact same as [IDOR Challenge 1]. We are presented with the web form, and some options to submit as our request to the server. As we are performing an IDOR, our goal is to reference data that should not be accessible to us. Following the same methodolgy as the last challenge, we find a familiar sight; however, the values look different.
