# Insecure Direct Object References Challenge 1

**Instructions:**

The result key for this challenge is stored in the private message for a user that is not listed below...

## Lab Walkthrough

Similar to the IDOR introduction, we need to find some way to influence the data that we submit to the web form. My approach did not need BurpSuite as some basic reconnaissance of the page's source code can reveal a little bit about how the developer implemented the method that actually accesses the data from the backend. 

To view a page's source code you can right click on the page or a specific element and select *inspect element*, or a little shortcut for chromium-based browsers is to hit Ctrl+Shift+I. A good place to start would be at the form we are submitting.

### Web form structure

So, from a very high level perspective, let's break down how this web form is functioning. We can see those **option** tags, within them containing the name of the user's profiles. However, notice how there is a value inside of the tag correlating with these names. In reference to the prompt, how can we manipulate something about these tags and submit requests that we aren't supposed to?

Let's look for a pattern in those values, we can see it incrementing in odd order: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9...

If the form is definitely displaying results for the odd numbered values, why not try submitting an option with a value of what comes next in the list, 11?

### Modifying request

Success! You were able to access a hidden user, performing an insecure direct object reference. I do also highly encourage you to find your own method... perhaps with BurpSuite.

To deepen your understanding, I'd like to go over some pseudo code as to how this may have been implemented and it can serve as a great example of what *not* to do when developing a web app.

```
*/
Let's say that the user data is stored in an array and the values in the
<option> tags correspond with the index of the array
*/

userArr[] = {NULL, user1, NULL, user3, NULL, user5}; // and so on and so forth

/*
Now we'd also need to implement the function that can access the data stored within that array.
This may be how the backend retrieves the data based on the request made via the frontend
*/

function getUserMessage(int value, _userArr[])
{
  return _userArr[value];
}
```

As you can see, there are no security measures preventing hidden users from being displayed. The getUserMessage function will simply return the value passed to it. There is nothing guarding any of the data that is meant to be protected, resulting in a potential IDOR attack.

With that in mind, when developing your own applications or working with developers, always be sure to note what is accessible and what is not, what should be, what shouldn't be, and how to implement those safeguards to prevent your own code from presenting this vulnerability.
